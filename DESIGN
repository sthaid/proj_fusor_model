DATA
- array of particles
- particles indexed by cu mm location, needs a list or an array at each location

INTERACTIONS
- ionization
- recombination
- collision
- movement
  . if goes outside chamber then reset speed to ambient temperature, and
    reset direction to within chamber, and reset position to within chamber

PARAMETERS
- chamber radius   
- grid radius
- grid voltage
- grid current
- pressure, can this be changed dynamically
- delta_t  (warn if becomes too big to process collisions)

CONSTANTS
- number of particles in the simulation
- location box size  (cu mm)

GRAPHS - X AXIS IS RADIUS
- number density of D and D ions
- temperature
- ionization and recombination rate

CHAMBER VIEW
- cross section xl to xh, yl to yh, z-deltaz/2 to z+deltaz/2
- ability to set deltaz, and to zoom in and out on an x,y

PROGRAMMING
- use integer math
  . x,y,z:  nanometers
  . velocity:  nanometers/sec
  . time:  nanoseconds
- use all available cores for particle sim
- main thread is for sdl display and control
- files
  . common.h
  . main.c
  . ionization.c
  . particles.c
  . readme
- locking
  . each thread will grab a location to process all particles at that
    location, and while doing that will own the mutex for that location
  . if a particle has moved into a location it will have already have been
    processed for this T, and thus will not be reporcessed
  . when moving a particle to a new location, will need to acquire the lock
    for that location

ASSUMPTIONS
- only D, no D2
