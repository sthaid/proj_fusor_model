INTRODUCTION
========================

This model should help understand the details of the interactions in the fusor: examples:
- the pressure and temperature of the ions at the center of the chamber
- the blue glue
- voltage fluctuations
Can also vary parameters to see what yields most fusion

This is a theory ...

========================
ELECTRONS
========================

Outside the grid ...

Once the grid voltage is high enough, the large electric field outisde the grid
will interact with the D atoms that are near the exterior of the grid. The electons
will be repelled with enough force so that they are stripped from the proton and
accelerated radially outward toward the chamber wall.

Back at the grid the situation has changed. There are now many D nucleus near the
grid, without electrons. These protons will be attacted toward the grid and will 
help liberate electrons from the grid itself. There is an abundance of excess electrons
on the grid, but not enough so that these electrons can leave the grid on their own.
The D nucleus protons near the grid provide an additional force to liberate electrons
from the grid. 

These free electrons will gain enough energy as they are accelerated toward the
chamber walls to ionize other D atoms that they may collide with.

Inside the grid ...

The XXX theory says that there is no electric field inside a charged metal container.
Our grid is similar to a charged metal container, so one would suspect that the electric
field from the grid does not extend inside of the grid. However since fusor grids have gaps
(my real fusor grid is just three wire loops, which has large gaps), the electric field from the grid will
also extend a little inside of the grid. So what this means is that electrons can be liberated
from the grid on the inside via the same mechanism that is discussed above, outside the grid.

The electrons liberated from the grid on the inside are likely to have a different fate than 
the electrons that were liberated on the outside. Before there is a build up of D ions at the
center of the chamber these electrons will meander accross the inside of the grid, and eventaully
find there way to the outisde, and be accelerated to the chamber wall. But, after there is a
concentration of D ions at the center of the chamber, these electrons will likely be 
captured by a D ion, and release a photon.

Summary ...

To summarize, the electrons liberated from the grid will either:
1) Be accelerated toward the chamber wall and reach the chamber wall without 
   interacting with any D atoms along the way.
2) Be accelerated toward the chamber wall and ionize one or more D atoms along the way.
   These ionized D will release their electrons, which may ionize additional D in a
   cascade. For example the single electron that was liberated from the grid may 
   cause 3 ionizations, and thus 4 electrons reaching the chamber wall.
3) XXX released inside the grid but not interact with D ion, maybe none there yet, 
   and .... then become category 1 or 2
4) Be released inside the grid, and be attracted toward the high concentration of 
   D ions that are present inside the grid (probably highest concentration at the center
   of the chamber). These electrons will combine with the ions and a photon will be released.

Prior to the plasma igniting the electrons that leave the grid will fall into 
categories 1 and 2 XXX nd 3 above. So more electrons will be returning to the power supply than are
leaving the power supply. Obviously this can not go on for long, and a balance needs to
be reached. After the plasma ignites (category 4), and reaches a steady state: 
- the current entering the chamber must equal the current leaving the chamber
- the D ionization rate must equal the D capture rate
  XXX what is oppoisite if ionziation?

========================
IONS     
========================

D ions are created either:
- the D atoms near the grid have their electrons stripped by the
  high electric field that exists near the grid; this probably happens 
  for just a short while prior to the plasma igniting
- the D atoms somewhere between the grid and chamber wall are ionized
  by an impact with an electron that has been accelerated away from the 
  grid

The D ions that were created near the grid should stay there. If one of these
D ions were to move toward the center of the grid it will be repelled by the
positively charge that has accumulated at and around the grid center. And if the
D ion were to move toward the chamber wall it would be pulled back towards the
grid by the electric field that the grid is generating. Other possibilities are
these D ions could be struck by the D ions that have been propelled to a high 
velocity toward the center of the chamber, or these D ions could absorb an electron.

The D ions that are created a substantial distance outside of the grid are 
most important for creating the plasma, and fusion. These ions are accelerated
by the grid's electric field toward the grid. When they cross from outside the
grid to inside the grid's electric field no longer influences their path. At this
point their path is influenced by the repulsive force of the ions that are 
closer to the chamber center than it is, and by collisions with the D ions and D
atoms that it is may encounter. The following scenarios are possible:
- if this ion's trajectory is not close to chamber center then it could be deflected
  away by the positive charges that are present near chamber center
- if this ion's trajectory is close to chamber center it could:
  - pass straight through with no interactions, it would then pass outside the grid and
    achieve the same distance from the grid at which it started it's inward jouney
  - direct impact another D ion with sufficient velocity to fuse and create HE 
    XXX what is the reaction
  - close pass to other D ions so that it looses velocity and changes direction (repeats), 
    and becomes part of the volume of D ion gas that accumulates at the center of the 
    chamber. The ions in the center of this gas will stay their for a while due to collisions
    with the ions around it. The ions near the edge of the gas will be repelled by the
    positive charge and be expelled from within the grid. Once outside the grid they will be
    pulled back inside; but not with the same high velocity as the ions that were created
    at a distance from the grid.
- If an electron is absorbed by the ion then it will become a D atom, and release a 
  photon. This D atom will eventually migrate out of the D ion gas and become part of the
  lower pressure D atom gas that is present throughout the chamber.

========================
ATOMS    
========================

The initial condition is the chamber is filled with the D atoms evenly
distributed at an initial pressure. The Ideal Gas Law can be used to determine
how many atoms there are. The velocities of the atoms is determined by XXX based
on them being at room temperature.

The excitement begins when the voltage is applied to the grid and current begins to flow.
Then atoms become ions, the ions are pulled toward the chamber's center by the grid's
electric field, where they collide and possibly fuse. The ions near the center of the
chamber will capture electrons, release phontons, and become atoms again.

The atoms that are created from the ions near the center of the chamber will 
migrate away from the center. How long this migration takes depends on how many
interactions are taking place between the ions and atoms present at the center of the
chamber. 

Atoms will try to approach the center of the chamber. They will not be repelled
by the positive charge at the center, but they will probably collide with the higher
ions that are at a higher pressure and density and be prevented from making their
way very far into the ion gas at chamber center.

Electrons
---------

- N physical electrons will be represented by 1 model electron
- each model electron will have the following characteristics
  - position: x,r,z,r^2
  - velocity: vx,vy,vz
- each model interval:
  - a quantity of model electrons will be released from the grid each dt,
    - initial position is slightly inside or outside the grid
    - initial velocity is XXX 
  - each model electron will do one of the following:
    - based on the D ion characteristics at the location, the model electron
      may be absorbed by a model D ion, causing:
      . the model D ion to become a model D atom
      . the model electron is removed 
    - based on the D atom characteristics at the location, the model electron
      may ionize the D atom, causing:
      . the model D ataom to become a model D ion
      . the creation of another model D electron
      . the velocity of the existing and new electrons will be determined based
        on conservation of energy and momemtum
    - have its velocity and position updated based on current position, velocity, 
      and electric field
  - if a model electron's updated position is outside the chamber then
    - this model electron will be removed f
    - it will be tabulated to keep track of the current leaving the chamber
      and the velocity profile of the electrons that strike the chamber wall

Electric Field
--------------

- Spherical symetry assumption, so field direction is radial, and strength
  is the same for all positions in the chamber of the same radius
- The last step of each model interval will recompute the electric field
  strength, at each radius interval. The quantity of ions, electrons, and
  the electric field of the grid will be used to calculate the field strength.
