INTRODUCTION
========================

Fusor Characteristics
- Spherical Chamber, no leaks, pressurized with D2 gas, grounded.
- Spherical Grid, made of very fine mesh so that there is no 
  collisions between the grid and any particles.
- XXX spherical symetry

Initial Conditions
- uniform distribution of the D2 gas
- voltage has just been applied to grid
- zero current flowing
- gas and chamber are at room temperature

Parameters
- Gas Pressure
- Grid Voltage

Questions
- Is D2 atomic or molecular, does this matter?

THE ELECTRONS
========================

Outside the grid ...

Once the grid voltage is high enough, the large electric field outisde the grid
will interact with the D2 atoms that are near the exterior of the grid. The electons
will be repelled with enough force so that they are stripped from the proton and
accelerated radially outward toward the chamber wall.

Back at the grid the situation has changed. There are now many D2 nucleus near the
grid, without electrons. These protons will be attacted toward the grid and will 
help liberate electrons from the grid itself. There is an abundance of excess electrons
on the grid, but not enough so that these electrons can leave the grid on their own.
The D2 nucleus protons near the grid provide an additional force to liberate electrons
from the grid. 

These free electrons will gain enough energy as they are accelerated toward the
chamber walls to ionize other D2 atoms that they may collide with.

Inside the grid ...

The XXX theory says that there is no electric field inside a charged metal container.
Our grid is similar to a charged metal container, so one would suspect that the electric
field from the grid does not extend inside of the grid. However since fusor grids have gaps
(my fusor grid is three wire loops, so has large gaps), the electric field from the grid will
also extend a little inside of the grid. So what this means is that electrons can be liberated
from the grid on the inside via the same mechanism that is discussed above, outside the grid.

The electrons liberated from the grid on the inside are likely to have a different fate than 
the electrons that were liberated on the outside. Before there is a build up of D2 ions at the
center of the chamber these electrons will meander accross the inside of the grid, and eventaully
find there way to the outisde, and be accelerated to the chamber wall. But, after there is a
concentration of D2 ions at the center of the chamber, these electrons will likely be 
captured by a D2 ion, and release a photon.

Summary ...

To summarize, the electrons liberated from the grid will either:
1) Be accelerated toward the chamber wall and reach the chamber wall without 
   interacting with any D2 atoms along the way.
2) Be accelerated toward the chamber wall and ionize one or more D2 atoms along the way.
   These ionized D2 will release their electrons, which may ionize additional D2 in a
   cascade. For example the single electron that was liberated from the grid may 
   cause 3 ionizations, and thus 4 electrons reaching the chamber wall.
3) Be released inside the grid, and be attracted toward the high concentration of 
   D2 ions that are present inside the grid (probably highest concentration at the center
   of the chamber). These electrons will combine with the ions and a photon will be released.

Prior to the plasma igniting the electrons that leave the grid will fall into 
categories 1 and 2 above. So more electrons will be returning to the power supply than are
leaving the power supply. Obviously this can not go on for long, and a balance needs to
be reached. After the plasma ignites (category 3), and reaches a steady state: 
- the current entering the chamber must equal the current leaving the chamber
- the D2 ionization rate must equal the D2 capture rate
